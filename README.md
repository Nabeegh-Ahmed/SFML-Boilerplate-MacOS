# SFML Boilerplate - Clion + MacOS

SFML Boilerplate allows you to quickly get up and running with a functional SFML app. While there aren't any concrete best practices revolving SFML, this project tries to follow some basic rules of thumb to create a better development experience.

## How to install?

Firstly, you need Clion on your system. We chose Clion as our IDE on MacOS because it is the most convenient one to set up for beginners.

- Install Clion from https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=mac
- Since Clion is actually paid, you need to apply for an education license using your university email at: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/
- Once you have Clion, you need to install SFML on your system. On MacOS, this is quite easy using Homebrew.
- Install Homebrew by following the instructions on this page https://brew.sh/
- Then open your terminal and type ```brew install sfml```
- Once these two steps are done, run Clion and open the downloaded project.
- Press the play button on the top-right corner and everything will be ready to go!
